# LaptopChargingStatus
Displays battery percentage, and notifies you when the battery is low or full!

# Purpose:
This program (programmed in Python 3) is designed to notify a user when they plug/unplug a charging cord,
notify them when the battery is low, or when the battery is full. This program was created because my laptop
(and many others) decided they no longer want to notify the user of a low battery, and most laptops never 
notify a user of a full battery. That's where this program comes into play. This is the source code of the
project, and an installer and compiled version will be soon released.

# Use:
Run main.py, and voil√†! The rest is done automatically.

# Installation:
Installer:
(Not yet released)

Source:
1) Clone / download our git either with the download button, or with:
```git clone https://github.com/Chadhendrixs/LaptopChargingStatus```
for linux distros.

2) ```cd``` into the git file, and run pip to install all required packages.
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

3)  Run main.py!

# Possible issues:
1) Very rarely will the terminal display a blank screen. In the event of this, just click on the terminal and press enter.
2) In the event of an update, it might take the terminal a few seconds to update the information, resulting in a blank screen. Just wait a few seconds and it sound update; otherwise look at issue 1.
